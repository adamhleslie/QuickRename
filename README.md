# QuickRename

Renames all .xwm files in the same directory for use with JRavens Extra Tracks Mod for Fallout 4, and saves a log of renames performed
.

Place QuickRename.exe in the same folder as your .xwm files, run the program, and view log.txt if at any point in the future if you need to know which file is which. If you run this multiple times, it will fill in the places between correctly named files. 
NOTE: If you don't have enough new files to fill the gap, say between MUS003 and MUS009 you get up to MUS005, log.txt will give a wrong number of total files, in this case with 5 files instead of 6 (including MUS001 - MUS005 and MUS009).
